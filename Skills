- must identify skills needed, and if we've achieved basic understanding, achieve an advanced understanding of each
    - important to learn g-code to edit and fire up a quick part, especially Manual Data Input
    - master *using* all of these things before buying them yourself so you know what to look for and can jump straight
    in

- must study daily new tech and mechanisms (25-35 min a day)
    - Manufacturing mondays
    - Time Travel Tuesdays (Review past novel tech that may not have gotten their opportunity)
    - Wombat Wednesdays (craziest new tech, most risky)
    - Throwback Thursdays (review past awesome marvels, tried and true mechanisms, etc.)
    - Future Fridays (Most Promising new tech)
- must learn as much as possible while young in as many labs, in as many fields as possible
- must eat right and work out properly to have energy to work into the night
- must have body and mind as sharp as possible to work as long as possible in pristine shape

Skills Needed to Use Shop-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The shop is not the goal, it's a material thing. The quickest pipeline between paper and product is the goal, and
knowing how to build this pipeline is even more important than the actual machines.

Process: Name of the game is quick transfer from paper to reality, with minimal changes as process proceeds.
1) Sketching Process
    - Goal: Produce a well-thought out sketch ready to be immediately implemented in CAD.
            Sketch has been properly calculated and predicted to perform as well as expected.
2) CAD mastery: Solidworks and Rhino3D
    - Goal: Produce a detailed model with machining in mind, and design to be easily changed.
            Model has been simulated when and where necessary
3) CAM mastery
    - Goal: Produce a promising path and technique to manufacturing whatever part.
4) Fabrication mastery
    - Goal: Can receive CAD/CAM model and deliver to a machinable state as quickly as possible.
5) Machining mastery
    - Goal: Receive fabricated product and deliver a product as quickly as possible.
6) 3D Printing mastery
    - Goal: Produce a prototype *to dimension* for fit test use, size studies

Skills to Build and Maintain Workspace----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Computer Mastery
    - Goal: Needed for computationally expensive tests as well as supporting AI shop manager.
2) Electrical Mastery
    - Goal: Needed for complex robotics projects as well as supplying necessary power to computers
3) Coding Mastery
    - Goal: Needed for quickly building testing programs as well as aiding programs.
            Produce automating and helpful complex programs on the fly quickly tojustify program being written
            in the first place.
            --> required: Python, C++

Skills to Maintain Mental Ability to Continue to Create-----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Learn Foreign Language [German]
2) Learn Musical Instrument [Electric Guitar]
3) Exercise Routine
4) Proper Diet
5) Yoga/Meditation

-->Comments
    1&2) These seem like unnecessary time wasters. I know. But doing the same thing every day dulls the brain and drains
    passion from the craft. Then, you're forced to take a break. Breaks are good and necessary, but when a break is
    spurred by boredom, it is a few weeks before you can come back. This cannot be the case. By diversifying your
    mind, you are better suited to not only take on challenging problems, but also -- more importantly -- to hit the
    same problems harder, consistently.
    3) Non-negotiable. Exercise will clear the mind as well as relieve massive stress levels. Also, if there
    is an insecurity tied here, the only option should be clear.
    4) Proper diet will prolong a sharp mind and a life used to create for others. It will enhance taste, and
    celebrate health.
    5) May include foam rolling. Necessary to maintain happiness and stress levels that undoubtedly arise
    in this challenging field.

Key Things:
1) Mastery only comes from great teachers and much practice. You can learn 10x more quickly with a teacher
than on your own, pursue a teacher(s) for each listed
